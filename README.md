# 80,000 Hours Career Quiz Mock-Up
Beatriz Borges

## Overview
A quick quiz mock-up, based on [80,000 Hours Career quiz](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-recommender/#/).
It's slightly more evolved than the typical mockup, but it's not totally functional either.

If you only want to see it running and not have to download it, check it out [on my website](http://obiwit.com/80k).

### Design
The original quiz is a single scroll-drown page, with unnecessarily large buttons. 
My take on this is to give each question its own page, which would allow for customizable paths, depeding on the previous answers (not needed right now, but surely useful as the quiz gets more complex). This also makes things less cluttered while still revealing how far along the quiz you are (through side navigation buttons).
Finally, it also looks neater and works better on all screen sizes (including tablets and mobile phones, althought, bear in mind, that this is not completely reponsive yet, and mainly developed for desktops), due to smaller buttons and the single question approach.

### Usability
I believe this mock-up makes the whole process much more intuitive, since as soon as the user answers a question, they are automatically directed to the next one. Furthermore, the user can easily navigate between questions using either the mouse, keyboard arrows, or the side nav buttons.
I also decided to 'hide' the about so that it is only visible when the user click on the respective button (a pop-up window appears). In addition to making things more readable, this also allows the user to not have to wave through unnecessary details if they're already familiar with the project.

### Development
Given that I did this from scratch, and although it's not the finished product, it took me about 3 (slightly intensive) days to get togehter. This is completely front-end (remember, this is only a mock-up!), but the real implementation would use the full stack.
