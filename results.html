<div id="management">
    <h2>Management consulting (for skill-building &amp; earning to give) </h2>
    <p>Consulting is a promising path, offering good career capital that keeps your options open and high earnings. However, it’s highly competitive and we have a limited understanding of its potential for direct impact. Consider a job in consulting if you have strong academic credentials, aren’t sure about your long-term plans and want to experience work in a variety of business environments, don't have a high-impact alternative immediately available, or you want to earn to give but are not a good fit for quantitative trading or technology entrepreneurship.</p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Must be able to put up with 60 hour work weeks, frequent travel, lots of powerpoints. High academic achievement a predictor, but technical knowledge not required.</p>
</div>

<div id="founder">
    <h2>Tech startup founder</h2>
    <p>Technology entrepreneurship is a very high-potential path, offering good career capital, with a chance of both high earnings and large direct impact. Overall, we think more people should try this path. However, it’s also one of the most difficult paths, and only suits a relatively small number of people. Consider this career if you think you can develop strong technical skills, as well as the ability to deal with high risk of failure, work very long hours and do something unconventional. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Intelligent, risk-taking, able to work very long hours for 3-7 years, high grit, independent, can develop strong technical skills.</p>
</div>

<div id="politics">
    <h2>Party politics</h2>
    <p>This is a very high-potential, though very competitive and high-risk path that can enable you to make a big difference through improving the operation of government and promoting important ideas. If you’re highly able, could tolerate being in the public eye and think you could develop a strong interest in politics, then we recommend learning more about this career to test your suitability.</p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Strong social skills, ability to toe the party line and withstand press scrutiny, long hours.</p>
</div>

<div id="charity">
    <h2>Founding effective non-profits (international development) </h2>
    <p>If you have gained expertise in a relevant part of international development, then we think there could be opportunities to found a non-profit that efficiently and transparently implements an evidence-backed intervention that doesn’t already have a non-profit focused on it, and seeking funding from strategic foundations and GiveWell. This could lead to a large impact, while also giving you substantial opportunities to learn about development and build career capital. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Well-rounded, risk-taking, very long hours, grit, independent, deep knowledge of relevant area.</p>
</div>

<div id="startup">
    <h2>Startup early employee</h2>
    <p>Being an early employee at a startup is similar to being a startup founder, except (i) the impact and financial return are usually lower (ii) the risk is lower (iii) the personal demands are lower. It's a promising path if you'd like to found a startup, but don't have a good idea and co-founder, or want a less demanding option. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> A generalist who's especially independent and risk seeking.</p>
</div>

<div id="phd">
    <h2>Economics PhD</h2>
    <p>An economics PhD is one of the most attractive graduate programs: if you get through, you have a high chance of landing a good research job in academia or policy - promising areas for social impact - and you have back-up options in the corporate sector since the skills you learn are in-demand (unlike many PhD programs). You should especially consider an economics PhD if you want to go into research roles, are good at maths (i.e. quant GRE score above 165) and have a proven interest in economics research. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Strong maths skills (i.e. 165+ on quant GRE), want to enter high-level research roles, prepared to work long hours.</p>
</div>

<div id="policy">
    <h2>Policy-oriented civil service</h2>
    <p>Working in the civil service doesn’t seem the most promising place to start your career, due to apparently poorer career capital from most roles. An exception is the UK’s ‘Fast Stream’, which provides rapid progression to management positions. It’s more promising, however, as an area to enter later in your career. We suspect that being involved in policy-setting provides substantial opportunities for a generally able, altruistic person to make a difference (although we’re uncertain about the extent to which this is true and keen to learn more). </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Well-rounded skill profile, happy to work in a very large organisation, able to stick to values in the face of political compromise.</p>
</div>

<div id="data">
    <h2> Data science (for skill-building &amp; earning to give) </h2>
    <p>If you have a PhD in a quantitative subject (or if you’re the type of person who would enjoy a quantitative PhD), but are not sure you want to go into academia, consider data science. It can provide the intellectual satisfaction of research, but with more immediate, tangible results, and more team work. And you'll get a great skill-set that's increasingly in-demand in a wide variety of important areas. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Strong quantitative skills (e.g. would consider doing a science PhD); strong interest in applied research; able to communicate technical ideas clearly to non-technical audiences.</p>
</div>

<div id="grantmaker">
    <h2>Foundation grantmaker</h2>
    <p>Foundation grantmakers help foundations decide where to make donations. They influence large amounts of money ($10M/year at large foundations), though they are often highly constrained in where they can allocate grants. They can also influence the direction of non-profits, build expertise and connections in a cause and make use of generous donation matching schemes for their personal giving. If you’re able to get a position at a foundation working on a promising cause, especially at program-officer level, it’s a promising option. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Expertise in a cause area (3+ years experience), well-rounded skill-profile, though interpersonal and communication skills especially important.</p>
</div>

<div id="trading">
    <h2>Trading in quantitative hedge funds (for earning to give)</h2>
    <p>For someone with strong quantitative skills, we think this represents one of the best career opportunities available. The pay is exceptionally good enabling earning to give, you can develop technical skills valued in academia or technology, and the work is satisfying. We've seen numerous cases of mathematicians taking this path and being highly satisfied. The main caveat is that the industry faces many risks - these activities could become unprofitable due to regulation or competition - so it's important to make sure you also build strong career capital. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Strong mathematical skills.</p>
</div>

<div id="think">
    <h2>Think tank research</h2>
    <p>Working in a think tank for a few years early in your career is a plausible way to influence government policy for the better, and in the meantime gain skills and contacts to advance your future career in politics or elsewhere, while doing work that's often fulfilling. Those with either great skills in quantitative analysis, or the ability to synthesise and communicate ideas clearly, should think carefully about how well it compares relative to their other opportunities, such as joining party politics. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Either good quantitative research or writing skills depending on the role; ability to synthesise and clearly communicate your and other people’s research; personal interest in some area of government policy.</p>
</div>

<div id="marketing">
    <h2> Marketing (for skill-building &amp; earning to give) </h2>
    <p>Spending a few years doing marketing in the private sector can teach you highly generalisable skills that can later be used in a wide range of industries and causes. You should consider marketing if you have good social and verbal skills, want a decent work life balance and want to keep your options open across causes. </p>
    <p><em>Key facts on fit:</em> Ability communicate ideas very clearly, very social and able to get on well with a wide range of people, want decent work life balance.</p>
